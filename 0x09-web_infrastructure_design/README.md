This README contains description of the 0x09-web_infrastructure_design tasks.


#0x09-web_infrastructure_design
*0-simple_web_stack:<br/>  Understanding Simple Web Stack Components
Description: Begin by comprehensively understanding the core components of a simple web stack, including the LAMP stack. Explain the roles of each element, such as the web server, application server, database server, and how they interact to deliver web content.

Requirements: Provide clear explanations for the purpose of each component and how they collaborate to serve web applications.

*1-distributed_web_infrastructure:<br/>  Designing a Distributed Web Infrastructure
Description: Design a distributed web infrastructure that improves reliability and performance. Explain the process of distributing components like web server, application server, and database servers across separate machines. Emphasize the benefits of distributing workload and minimizing Single Points of Failure (SPOFs).

Requirements: Provide a diagram of the distributed infrastructure, detail the distribution of components, and explain the advantages of this approach.

* Task 2-secured_and_monitored_web_infrastructure:<br/>  Enhancing Security and Monitoring
Description: Enhance the web infrastructure from Task 2 by incorporating security measures and monitoring components. Explain the implementation of firewalls and SSL protection for encrypted traffic. Detail the role of monitoring clients in tracking system performance.

Requirements: Explain the purpose of firewalls, the significance of SSL encryption, describe the monitoring process, and its importance for maintaining a secure and healthy environment.

* Task 3-scale_up:<br/> Scaling Up the Web Infrastructure
Description: Design a scaled-up version of the web infrastructure from Task 3. Eliminate SPOFs by distributing major components to separate GNU/Linux servers. Describe how SSL protection, firewalls, and monitoring apply to this enhanced environment.

Requirements: Provide a diagram of the scaled-up infrastructure, explain the removal of SPOFs, and detail how security measures and monitoring are integrated.
