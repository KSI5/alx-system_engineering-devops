Task: Using SFTP command-line tool to upload screenshots
To complete the command_line_for_the_win project, the following steps were performed using the SFTP command-line tool:

#0-first_9_tasks.png
Opened the terminal on the local machine and navigated to the project directory.
Initiated the SFTP command by providing the hostname, username, and password specific to the sandbox environment.
Established a successful connection to the sandbox environment.
Navigated to the command_line_for_the_win directory within the remote environment.
Utilized the put command to upload the screenshots from the local machine to the remote server.
For example, the command put /path/to/local/screenshot.png was used to upload the Task 0-9.png file to the destination file named 0-first_9_tasks.png within the command_line_for_the_win directory.
Checked the remote directory in the sandbox environment to verify the successful upload of the screenshots.
